# LLM Road Surface PSCI Prompts

> Complete prompt templates and example code for zero-shot LLM-based Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) evaluation.

## Overview

This repository contains five prompt-engineering strategies (Models 1–5) designed to harness large language models (e.g., GPT-4o) for automatic road-surface condition grading on PSCI’s 10-point scale. 
Each model’s full prompt text and example notebook demonstrate how to send images and instructions to the LLM API in a reproducible zero-shot setting.

## Prompt Strategies Summary

Model 1 – Role-Playing

Model 2 – Contextual Anchoring

Model 3 – Instruction Refinement

Model 4 – Step-by-Step Decomposition

Model 5 – Chain-of-Thought & Multi-Step Reasoning (highest accuracy)
