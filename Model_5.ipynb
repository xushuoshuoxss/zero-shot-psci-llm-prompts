    "        \n",
    "    1. Ravelling (surface defects)\n",
    "        Appearance: Surface looks rough with small aggregate particles missing; advanced ravelling shows a worn surface with larger aggregates exposed.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Loss of surface material, especially in wheel paths or edges.\n",
    "    2. Bleeding (surface defects)\n",
    "        Appearance: Shiny, reflective, and often sticky-looking patches on the road, especially in wheel paths.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Dark, shiny spots that appear wet or oily but are not due to moisture.\n",
    "    3. Cracking (Longitudinal, Transverse, Reflection, Slippage) (pavement defects)\n",
    "        Appearance: Longitudinal cracks run parallel to the road center; transverse cracks run perpendicular; slippage cracks are crescent-shaped.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Linear cracks either along the road or crossing it, with potential for further deterioration.\n",
    "    4. Rutting (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Deep, long, narrow depressions in the wheel paths.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Visible grooves or channels where vehicles frequently pass.\n",
    "    5. Alligator Cracking (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Cracks that form a grid or \"chicken wire\" pattern resembling alligator skin.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Small, interconnected cracks, often seen in areas with heavy traffic loading.\n",
    "    6. Edge Cracking/Breakup (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Cracks that develop along the edges of the pavement, usually within 300mm from the edge.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Linear cracks or broken pavement material along the road edges.\n",
    "    7. Surface Distortion (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Wavy or uneven road surface with depressions or bumps, but not necessarily in wheel paths.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Deformations that create dips, sags, or humps, reducing smoothness.\n",
    "    8. Patching (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Sections of pavement that have been repaired with new material, often different in color or texture.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Visible patches with irregular borders; may have cracks or be sinking.\n",
    "    9. Potholes (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Circular or irregular depressions where part of the pavement has crumbled away.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Bowl-shaped holes in the surface, sometimes with water or loose debris inside.\n",
    "    10. Road Disintegration (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Large, rough, and cratered sections of the road where most of the pavement surface is gone.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Areas where the road surface is severely broken, exposing the underlying layers.\n",
