    "        Appearance: Longitudinal cracks run parallel to the road center; transverse cracks run perpendicular; slippage cracks are crescent-shaped.\n",

    "        Key Visual Clue: Visible grooves or channels where vehicles frequently pass.\n",
    "    5. Alligator Cracking (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Cracks that form a grid or \"chicken wire\" pattern resembling alligator skin.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Small, interconnected cracks, often seen in areas with heavy traffic loading.\n",
    "    6. Edge Cracking/Breakup (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Cracks that develop along the edges of the pavement, usually within 300mm from the edge.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Linear cracks or broken pavement material along the road edges.\n",

    "        Appearance: Wavy or uneven road surface with depressions or bumps, but not necessarily in wheel paths.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Deformations that create dips, sags, or humps, reducing smoothness.\n",
    "    8. Patching (structural distresses)\n",
    "        Appearance: Sections of pavement that have been repaired with new material, often different in color or texture.\n",
    "        Key Visual Clue: Visible patches with irregular borders; may have cracks or be sinking.\n",

    "        Appearance: Circular or irregular depressions where part of the pavement has crumbled away.\n",
